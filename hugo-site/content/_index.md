### Background
I've been fascinated by computers from a young age, always eager to unravel their intricacies. My journey into programming began in high school, where I crafted a couple of video games in Java. Since then, my passion for understanding and working with computers has led me to evolve into a Site Reliability Engineer.

I've progressed through various roles, starting as a Registrar at PARC, and advancing to a SysAdmin, ultimately reaching the position of a Systems and Software Engineer. This career trajectory allowed me to amass a diverse skill set and deepen my expertise in IT systems and software development.
