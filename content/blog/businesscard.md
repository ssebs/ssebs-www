## Why?

Why create a business card? Honestly, I don’t need one, but I’ve always liked the idea of having a physical item that reflects my work and personality. Given that most of my time is spent in front of a computer or in meetings, it’s not something I’ll use often.

The *real* reason why I made this was to test out my new [3D Effect Plate](https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/bambu-3d-effect-plate?variant=43050930241672) that I got for Christmas. (Thanks to my wife \<3)


## Carbon Fiber Effects Plate
This plate transfers its pattern onto prints, creating a carbon fiber texture on one face of the object. Basically, the plastic from the 3D printer will melt into the tiny grooves that make up the carbon fiber pattern. Once the print cools, the pattern remains on the plastic surface. 

I was eager to play with this, and figured this would be a good time to design my own business card.

## Design Process
I tried finding business card templates on thangs.com, but I wasn't happy with what I had found. Since I'm trying to learn 3D Modeling for my [Mini Macro Pad](./projects/go-mmp), I figured I could brush up on those skills with this.

I used OnShape for the design process. It’s a free platform, which means all my models are public—feel free to check out [the CAD model](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/aabb4c335eb2458dde4d51ec/w/b49ce9eb70262ddbb26c451c/e/c4db99ca65cc197bea632cba?renderMode=0&uiState=676e3b88fd01706f5f654a9f) if you're curious!

## Finished prints
It took 3 iterations to get the design just right, but I’m pretty happy with the final result. I especially like that the card is transparent, so you can see the details in the light.

Here's what the front of my business card looks like:

The back features the carbon fiber texture:

As for how I’ll use this card… who knows? Maybe I’ll hand it out at an AWS Summit or drop it in a bowl to win a free dinner. Either way, it’s a fun, functional piece that showcases my creativity and growing skills in 3D modeling.
