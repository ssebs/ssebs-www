- What is "AI"
  - Super brief summary
  - How people are using it / hype around replacing SWEs
  - Vibe Coding vs AI Assisted Coding 
- Trying out "vibe coding" - **VSCode extension**
  - > What DOESN'T work (rely on it to think for me)
  - What I wanted
  - What I did (not look at the code)
  - What's the problem (laggy, telling the computer to figure out problems can only get you so far)
  - What's next
- Trying out AI assisted coding - **Dank Nooner**
  - > What DOES work (use it to be more efficient)
  - Use AI as a tool, not as a replacement for thinking
  - E.g. 1 - Boilerplate (I have `x` pattern, now implement it for `y`, `z`)
  - E.g. 2 - Planning (I have this problem, and I think I can do this to solve it, what are alternatives & how do they compare, how will they fit in my codebase)
  - E.g. 3 - Implement things I'd have to google, saving time. (AABB bounding box, Skel/Bone generation from Dict)
- How I can stay relevant, and sharp - **Summary / Lessons Learned**
  - > in a time where the world wants us to rely on AI, find what works for you. 
  - Don't give up planning on your own, think the problem through
  - Once you have an idea, write it down & verify it
  - Use AI to boost productivity, not to replace thinking
