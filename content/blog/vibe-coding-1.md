## First off, what is AI?

### Super Brief Summary

### How people are using it / hype around replacing SWEs

### Vibe Coding vs AI Assisted Coding 


{{< clearfix >}}


## Trying out "vibe coding" - **VSCode extension**
  - > What DOESN'T work (rely on it to think for me)
### What I wanted

### What I did (not look at the code)

### What's the problem (laggy, telling the computer to figure out problems can only get you so far)

### What's next

## Trying out AI assisted coding - **Dank Nooner**

> What DOES work (use it to be more efficient)

### Use AI as a tool, not as a replacement for thinking

### E.g. 1 - Boilerplate (I have `x` pattern, now implement it for `y`, `z`)

### E.g. 2 - Planning (I have this problem, and I think I can do this to solve it, what are alternatives & how do they compare, how will they fit in my codebase)

### E.g. 3 - Implement things I'd have to google, saving time. (AABB bounding box, Skel/Bone generation from Dict)

## How I can stay relevant, and sharp - **Summary / Lessons Learned**

> in a time where the world wants us to rely on AI, find what works for you. 

### Don't give up planning on your own, think the problem through

### Once you have an idea, write it down & verify it

### Use AI to boost productivity, not to replace thinking
