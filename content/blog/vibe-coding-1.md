## First off, what is AI?

### Super Brief Summary

## Trying out "vibe coding" - **VSCode extension**
> What DOESN'T work (rely on it to think for me)

Check out the [VSCode Extension](https://github.com/ssebs/todo-sidebar) for yourself!


### What I wanted
During the development of [Dank Nooner's rewrite](/projects/dank-nooner), I needed some way to track my todo's & tasks. I didn't want to go full Kanban, but needed more than a simple Markdown file.

I was using a TODO.md file with H2 sections & a list of nested checkboxes, but I wanted something that I could drag-n-drop, and check things off. 

Unable to find a decent solution, I decided to give vibe coding a try.

### What I did

I created a brand new VSCode extension following their docs, and got to work.

By got to work, I mean wrote a README.md explaining what I wanted the extension to do, and a sample TODO.md file with the format that I was already using.

In about 2-3 days of using Claude Code's Pro plan (damn token limitations!), I got a functional app going. During this time, I simply told it what I wanted added, referenced a CLAUDE.md file, and let it rip. I didn't look at the code until it was working, and even then I just skimmed it.

It was able to get things about ~80% of the way there, but actually using the extension gave me more TODOs to copy/paste. And more errors.

### What's the problem 

(laggy, telling the computer to figure out problems can only get you so far)

### What's next

## Trying out AI assisted coding - **Dank Nooner**

> What DOES work (use it to be more efficient)

### Use AI as a tool, not as a replacement for thinking

### E.g. 1 - Boilerplate (I have `x` pattern, now implement it for `y`, `z`)

### E.g. 2 - Planning (I have this problem, and I think I can do this to solve it, what are alternatives & how do they compare, how will they fit in my codebase)

### E.g. 3 - Implement things I'd have to google, saving time. (AABB bounding box, Skel/Bone generation from Dict)

## How I can stay relevant, and sharp - **Summary / Lessons Learned**

> in a time where the world wants us to rely on AI, find what works for you. 

### Don't give up planning on your own, think the problem through

### Once you have an idea, write it down & verify it

### Use AI to boost productivity, not to replace thinking
