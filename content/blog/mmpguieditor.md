This is a follow up to the [Mini Macro Pad](/blog/minimacropad/) project, so I'd suggest reading that if you haven't already.

## Learning Golang

## Writing a GUI



## Making changes to your Macros, made easy.
I was content with what I had written, for a while at least. I was talking about my project with some coworkers, and they mentioned that it wasn't super user friendly to update the Macros. I agreed, as YAML was a decent file format for a developer, but not everyone wants to be slinging YAML whenever they need to create a new shortcut.

So it was decided - I had to make a GUI Config Editor. I wanted to make an interface similar to what you'd find in a Logitech or Razor keyboard driver. Obviously not as complex, but enough to meet the need.

I started designing a quick UI, and got to work on my `v2` release.
