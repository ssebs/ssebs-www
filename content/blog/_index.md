Here I share the stories behind my projects—the process, the challenges, and the lessons learned. From building tools like the Mini Macro Pad to trying out new programming ideas, it’s all about figuring things out and having fun along the way. 

If you’re curious about what worked, what didn’t, and how it all came together, check out my latest posts below!


Blog entry planning:

## Mini Macro Pad
- Why I want a macro pad / what is it?
- Solution idea
- Physical device
- C => Python => Go
- Writing a GUI in fyne
- anakin_its_working.gif
- What's next for v2?
  - Link to gui editor at the end

## GUI Editor
- Read Mini Macro Pad before this one
  - "This is part 2 of my MMP project"
- What's wrong with v1 / story
- Solution idea
- Expanding GUI in fyne
- Fun with DnD
- Having issues with state / GUI not syncing
  - Realize I need to organize / structure my code better
  - I find it best to learn by doing, so to learn MVC I need to implement it myself.
  - Link to MVC Tip Calc
- Using what I learned from my tip calc to implement MVC for my MMP
- v2 released / what's new with the release
- What's next for v3?
  - See github issues

## Learning MVC w/ Tip Calc
- Why I wrote this (See GUI Editor)
- What is MVC?
  - Model
  - View
  - Controller
- Solution idea (for tip calc)
- Implementing / screenshots
- Bringing it all together / what I learned
- See how this helped with my GUI Editor (link again)
