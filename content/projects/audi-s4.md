I used to own a 2014 Audi S4 (B8.5), had a few mods done, but ultimately it was too expensive to keep ðŸ˜­.

## Mods:
- [VMR V801 Wheels](https://vmrwheels.com/products/v801-titanium-black-shadow)
- RS style grille
- [CTS Turbo Cold Air Intake](https://www.ctsturbo.com/product/cts-turbo-audi-b8-b8-5-s4-s5-q5-sq5-air-intake-system/)
  - Mostly for the sound!
- [ECS Tuning Trunk Lip Spoiler](https://www.ecstuning.com/b-maxton-design-parts/trunk-spoiler-gloss-black/au-s4-b8f-cap1-g/)
- [ECS Tuning Stage 1 ECU+TCU tune](https://www.ecstuning.com/b-integrated-engineering-parts/stage-1-ie-performance-tune-includes-tcu-tune/iesocgj1tcu/)
  - This bumped my power from 333 to 418!

## Problems
- A turkey jumped in front of my car one day, causing lots of damage
  - {{< image src="./img/s4_turkey.jpg" title="smashed windshield on my car" class="w-[300px]" >}}
- My [Catalitic Converters failed](https://www.audizine.com/forum/showthread.php/760957-The-Official-Blown-Catalytic-Converter-Thread), and I ended up selling my car at this point.
  - > I let the buyer know they were failing smog
  - I was quoted $6k to replace them! Insane.
