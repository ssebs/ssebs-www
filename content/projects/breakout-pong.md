Welcome to the start of it all: Breakout-Pong. This was the very first game I made. ‘Twas the final project of the first semester of AP Computer Science. I thought that making a simple Pong remake would be easy. Little did I know that having to learn OpenGL along with Java would mean a lot of googling.

Breakout Pong is a mix between the game Pong and the game Breakout. It plays like a horizontal breakout until you break down the wall. Then it’s all high-pace Pong action-with two balls! 

[Here](https://github.com/ssebs/BreakoutPongGame/raw/master/BreakoutPong.jar) is a link to the github repo, I need to rebuild this but I'll get to that at some point. 

Use the A,D,Left, and Right keys and you’re all set!

[Check out my old code on github](https://github.com/ssebs/BreakoutPongGame/).
