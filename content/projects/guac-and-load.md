> Okay... what does that mean?

It's a restaurant simulator, like Fast Food Simulator or Supermarket Simulator, but with a twist:

Some of the customers got **Z-Coli**, and have been turned into zombies! You'll need to fight to survive!

## What's the status?
I've been working on this since February 2025, and I plan to release the game in July 2025!

## What's the Gameplay like?
### 👨‍🍳 Start Your Shift
- Cook rice, beans, and meats
- Make some guac and stock your trays
- Build burrito bowls for customers
- Run the register and keep the line moving

### 🧟 But Watch Out...
- Some customers can get aggressive, must be the Z-Coli outbreak!
- Grab kitchen tools or the guac gun to fight back
- Survive furious ex-customers and keep the restaurant alive

### 🌀 Gameplay Loop
Each shift starts calm—just another day behind the counter. But after a while, everything changes. The pressure builds. The music shifts. The customers? Not so friendly anymore.

### ✅ Features:
- Buying, cooking, chopping different types of food.
- Preparing customer's orders. A customer has a specific order that you must fulfill, you get money based on how accurate your order is.
- Zombies (infected by Z-Coli) will come and you'll need to fight to survive.
