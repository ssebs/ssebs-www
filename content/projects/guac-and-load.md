## What is it?
**Guac and Load** is what I'm calling my first 3D video game. It's a fast-paced restaurant sim where chaos in the kitchen leads to a fight for survival.

> Okay... what does that mean?

It's a restaurant simulator, like Fast Food Simulator or Supermarket Simulator, but with a twist:

Once you start missing orders, some of the customers are a **lot** more... "impatient" than others. Some are even willing to fight for their food! You need to *Guac and Load* to fight them off and survive.

## What's the status?
I'm still early in development, so the gameplay, story, and art are all subject to change. I keep my [Itch.io page](https://theofficialssebs.itch.io/guac-and-load) updated, so check it out for the latest playable demo.

I'm very early in the development cycle, and lots of the gameplay/story/art is subject to change. I started this project around early February, 2025. I'm hoping to release the demo by June 2025, and if there's enough interest then release a whole game!

## What's the Gameplay like?
At first, it’s just another busy day at the restaurant—cooking, assembling orders, and keeping up with the lunch rush. But if things spiral out of control, customers won’t just leave bad reviews. Some of them get *aggressive*.  

- **Cooking & Prep** – Before the doors open, you’ll need to get everything ready. Cook the rice, beans, and meat, chop the veggies, and keep the trays stocked. Running out mid-shift? Better restock fast before customers lose their patience.  

- **Making Orders** – Customers place their orders, and it’s up to you to assemble them quickly and accurately. Bowls, burritos, extra guac—it’s all about speed and precision in this first-person minigame.  

- **Running the Register** – Once the food is ready, it’s time to cash out. Customers tip based on accuracy, and some might grab extra items on the way out. Keep the line moving, because the rush never stops.  

- **Keeping the Restaurant Running** – Each shift gets tougher, with bigger rushes, trickier orders, and new ingredients to manage. The better you perform, the more you unlock—but the pressure never lets up.  

- **When Chaos Hits** – Too many mistakes, and some customers won’t take "sorry" for an answer. Suddenly, it’s not just about running a restaurant—it’s about making it out in one piece.  
  - Grab whatever you can find and turn it into a weapon.  
  - Fend off waves of furious ex-customers in round-based combat.  
  - Survive long enough to escape and live to serve another day.  

It’s a fast-paced restaurant sim—until it isn’t. How long can you keep things under control?

## Should I release on Steam?
I'm planning to release the demo of the game for free on [Itch.io page](https://theofficialssebs.itch.io/guac-and-load), but I'm still debating whether or not I should also release it on Steam.

Publishing to Steam would mean more of an audience for the game, but also I have to pay $100 up-front, and write up a whole page. 

Let me know what you think!
