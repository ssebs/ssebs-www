A Platformer of Some Sort was my first long-term project. This was a wild 3 month process to make A Platformer Of Some Sort, which was a working title, but we had decided to leave it as such because it worked. This game took so long because I was unable to figure out the hit boxes and jumping, both of which are mediocre at best™ *Not a real Trademark

A Platformer Of Some Sort is just that, a platformer of some sort! It’s fairly simple, with a whopping 3 levels. Some animations are-lets say-not polished. There is a ridiculously funny story which was hand-written at the end of a long day of SAT’s, so you have to play the game and have a nice laugh. 

[Here](https://github.com/ssebs/Platformer/raw/master/APlatformerOfSomeSort.jar) is a link to download the game. Just double click the jar and use the WASD keys and you’re all set!
