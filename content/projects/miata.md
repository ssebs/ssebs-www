I own and drive a 2021 Mazda MX-5 RF GT (Miata). This is my first daily driven stick shift car, and it's so fun to drive!

## I've done a few mods to my car:
- Carbon fiber spoiler
  - This is an eBay special, wrapped in carbon fiber vinyl
- [SmartTOP](https://www.good-win-racing.com/Mazda-Performance-Part/61-2192.html)
  - This lets me put the top up/down without having to hold the button. Super useful!
- [Goodwin Racing RoadsterSport SuperStreet Exhaust](https://www.good-win-racing.com/Mazda-Performance-Part/61-1787.html)
  - With the [baffle](https://www.good-win-racing.com/Mazda-Performance-Part/60-1325ND.html) so I don't annoy my neighbors
- [Progress Lowering Springs](https://www.good-win-racing.com/Mazda-Performance-Part/61-1847RF.html)
  - This helps me around turns, flat out!
- Phone mount
  - I got a [phone mount](https://www.cravenspeed.com/the-gemini-phone-mount-for-mazda-mx-5-miata-rf-4th-gen-nd-vent-scissor/?srsltid=AfmBOorZgT2I4wws-0FWGw6N6hf0mnEBlPrBBsnKbfwC3mVehEV6okWz) when I had an iPhone, but since moving to Android I didn't have Magsafe anymore.
  - So, I designed and 3D printed a [Pop socket adapter](https://thangs.com/designer/sebsafari/3d-model/Pop%20Socket%20Adapter%20-949380?source=mymodels)
