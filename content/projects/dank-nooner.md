## But why?
After [Guac & Load](./projects/guac-and-load/)'s development, I was pretty tired of gamedev. I started doing other things with my time, including learning how to ride a [motorcycle](./projects/ninja-500/).

I heard the term "dank nooner", which is basically a crazy wheelie where the bike is so high up, it's close to 12 o'clock (aka noon). I loved this term, and got the idea to come up with a basic wheelie control game similar to those old flash games, so I got to work.

## So how's the progress?
I figured it would take a couple weeks, and I got most of the basic mechanics down in that time. After all my time working on Guac & Load, progress was pretty quick! I learned a ton working on it, so the basics for the new game was done in about a week or two.

I'm not setting a deadline for this game, and will just work on it when I'm in the mood, but I have a few features & polish that I want to add. 

I've got the To-Do list on [Github](https://github.com/ssebs/danknooner), feel free to submit an issue to request a feature!

For now, the game is playable, so check it out on [Itch.io!](https://theofficialssebs.itch.io/dank-nooner)
