## What is it?

**Dank Nooner V1** is a wheelie challenge game where you try to hold a wheelie for as long as you can & earn points to upgrade your bike. [V2 is coming soon](/projects/dank-nooner/#v2---coming-soon) with a full open-world experience!

### The controls:
- Click & hold your Left Mouse Button to "grip the throttle"
- While holding LMB, move your mouse up/down to speed up, and left/right to steer.
- Pressing Shift while in a run will give you a speed boost.

This game is open source, check out the code & upcoming features at https://github.com/ssebs/DankNooner

## But why?
After [Guac & Load](./projects/guac-and-load/)'s development, I was pretty tired of gamedev. I started doing other things with my time, including learning how to ride a [motorcycle](./projects/ninja-500/).

I heard the term "dank nooner", which is basically a crazy wheelie where the bike is so high up, it's close to 12 o'clock (aka noon). I loved this term, and got the idea to come up with a basic wheelie control game similar to those old flash games, so I got to work.

## V2 - Coming Soon!

I'm working on a major rewrite of Dank Nooner! V2 will be a full open-world 3D experience built in Godot.

### What's planned for V2:
- **Physics-Based Controls**: Manage clutch, throttle, and balance with ragdoll crash physics
- **Multiplayer**: Competitive races, co-op missions, and free-roam riding with friends
- **Open World**: Explore a city, hillside, race track, and dirt track areas
- **Tricks System**: Fill your nitrous meter by pulling off tricks like wheelies, stoppies, and more
- **Story Mode**: Narrative progression with missions
- **Progression System**: Start on a bicycle and work your way up to sport bikes, learning new tricks along the way
- **Bike Customization**: Upgrade and customize your rides

Check out the [Github repo](https://github.com/ssebs/DankNooner) for updates on V2 development!
