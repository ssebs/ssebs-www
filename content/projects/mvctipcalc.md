Simple Model View Controller Fyne project that doubles as a tip calculator.

The purpose of this is for me to learn MVC architecture, as well as using this as a template repo.

## Screenshot of the UI

## More about why
I created this side project while working on https://ssebs.com/projects/go-mmp/. I was expanding the UI from a simple grid of buttons to include a Drag and Drop interface to edit the Macros.
