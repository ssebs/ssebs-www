Mortal Kombat like Game written in Java, back in highschool.

This game was the bread and butter of my second semester in AP Computer Science. This game took from March to June to make. Another 3 month game, but this time, it was an actual game. 

The idea for this game came from the recent release of Mortal Kombat X, *Which this is definitely not copying...* Itâ€™s called "*being synonymous*", not "*stealing ideas*". Anyways, It was the game I spent the most amount of non-futile (Platformer) effort on.

Perishable Punchers, which is **synonymous** to the *allegedly* more popular "Mortal Kombat", has many features. It has such things as: **Kunching** (Kick-Punching), Fireballs, and epic sound effects. 

Try it out and have a (fire)ball! [Here](https://github.com/ssebs/PerishablePunchers/raw/master/PerishablePunchers.jar) is a link to download the game. Just double click the jar and follow the controls on screen!

Note: you must use an old version of Java :c
