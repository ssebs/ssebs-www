## Story
I've always wanted a motorcycle, and I finally decided to get one. Now that I'm a bit older, I've got the self-control not to do anything crazy with it.

I took the [CMSP](https://motorcyclesafetyca.com/) course over a weekend, got my license, and got myself a bike! (With a bunch of gear too)

## Mods
- OEM frame sliders
- Tail tidy / fender delete
- TechSpec SnakeSkin tank grips
- Puig Z Racing windscreen
- Leo Vince GP Corsa Evo Exhaust
