My name is **Sebastian Safari**, I call myself a "professional fixer, hobbyist figure-outer". 

I work as a Site Reliability Engineer and like to make side projects. These projects range from making video games, 3D printing, and programming things for myself or my family. I also have a few other hobbies like playing guitar, working on my car, and spending time with my Wife and our dog.

## My background
I've been fascinated by computers from a young age, always eager to unravel their intricacies. My journey into programming began in high school, where I make a couple of video games in Java. Since then, my passion for understanding and working with computers has led me to evolve into a Site Reliability Engineer.

I've progressed through various roles, starting as a Registrar at PARC, and advancing to a SysAdmin, ultimately reaching the position of a Systems and Software Engineer. This career trajectory allowed me to amass a diverse skill set and deepen my expertise in IT systems and software development.

## Where I am now
In my current role as a Site Reliability Engineer at Meta, I've led multiple 3rd party app onboardings, crafted disaster recovery solutions, and standardized processes for efficiency. 

Recently, I've been working as a full-stack developer for an internal tool. Ranging from React, Hack (php), and Python, I've been having fun! I can't say too much about the specifics, but I've been adding impactful features & trying to improve the reliability of the app.

### Some of my values:
- I always try to find efficient ways to solve problems.
- I like doing things the right way, I'm not a fan of "half-assing" work. If you're going to do it, do it right.
- I typically think of the MVP - the Minimum Viable Product as the goal. Once that's complete we can think about soft requirements and fun features.
- Teaching others as I learn is key. I believe you only really *know* something when you can teach someone else.
