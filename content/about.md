My name is Sebastian Safari, I call myself a "professional fixer, hobbyist figure-outer". 

Basically, I work as a Site Reliability Engineer and like to program various projects. I also have a few other hobbies like playing guitar, working on my car, and spending time with my Wife and our dog.

Online, I go by <span class="text-quaternary">ssebs</span>. Like most usernames, I came up with that when I was a kid. Basically a combination of my first and last name.

## My background

I've been fascinated by computers from a young age, always eager to unravel their intricacies. My journey into programming began in high school, where I crafted a couple of video games in Java. Since then, my passion for understanding and working with computers has led me to evolve into a Site Reliability Engineer.

I've progressed through various roles, starting as a Registrar at PARC, and advancing to a SysAdmin, ultimately reaching the position of a Systems and Software Engineer. This career trajectory allowed me to amass a diverse skill set and deepen my expertise in IT systems and software development.

## Where I am now
In my current role as a Site Reliability Engineer at Meta, I've led multiple 3rd party app onboardings, crafted disaster recovery solutions, and automated and standardized processes for efficiency. Proficient in Python, Linux, Chef, and DevOps practices, I've played a key role in driving project success across many projects.

### The way I like to work:
- With efficiency, I try to think of better / more efficient ways to solve problems
- Doing things the right way, I'm not a fan of half-assing work. I'd rather do it the right way.
- Focus on the details, but also think of the bigger picture.
- I typically think of the MVP - the Minimum Viable Product as the goal. Once that's complete we can think about soft requirements and fun features.
- Teach others as I learn, why not share my new found knowledge! I love to both mentor, and learn from others.
